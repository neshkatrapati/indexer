When a specific line is needed, it hits the index first, then the original file.\r\n\r\n## Why ?\r\nFor huge files, loading up particular lines on demand is too time taking in the simple way. Indexer is one approach to load them faster.\r\n\r\n## How to run  ?\r\n> #### Compile\r\n    $ gcc index.c -o index.o\r\n> #### Make the index\r\n    $ ./index.o -w source_file index_file\r\n> #### Read a line\r\n    $ ./index.o -r -l line_number source_file index_file\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
